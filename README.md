# Little website experiment about my father's carpentry enterprise
First independently started project by myself, implementing lore I gained last month. Hopefully main part will be finished 
in a period of three weeks, not so quickly due to my responsibilities that pertain exams on college. This work will contain
HTML,CSS and a little bit of Jquery, also during the process of making I am trying to build more knowledge regarding git and github
